You can add custom dimension name with its namespace id (like `your_namespace:your_dim`) to make this plugin support them


    dimension_region_folder:
        # These are the vanilla dimensions
        # It's not supposed to change these if plugin works
        # Only change these when these were changed by mods or mojang in new versions
        '-1':
          - DIM-1/region
          - DIM-1/poi
        '0':
          - region
          - poi
        '1':
          - DIM1/region
          - DIM1/poi

        # Add your custom dimensions here
        # For example:
        "your_namespace:your_dim":
        # We assumed the MCA paths of this dim are these here
        # Actual paths should match your own actual situation
          - DIM-custom-dim/region
          - DIM-custom-dim/poi
