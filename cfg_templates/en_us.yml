# Main switch of RFUMulti
# Set it to 'true' to enable
enabled: false

# Decides if RFUMulti loads custom translation
# External language folder: config/region_file_updater_multi/lang
# After enabled, place your translations in this folder
# File name format: {locale}.yml (like 'en_us.yml')
# Language keys could be found in plugin archive 'lang' folder

# ===========================================
command:
  # Command prefix
  # Set your preferred command prefixes here
  # eg: command_prefix: '!!rfum' -> !!rfum add / !!rfum update
  command_prefix:
    - '!!rfum'
    - '!!region'

  # Permission level requirements for each commands
  # Players does not have the level configured here are banned to execute the corresponding command

# ==========================================
update_operation:
  # When executing update command:
  # Update countdown will start immediately if disabled
  update_requires_confirm: true
  # If 'update_requires_confirm' enabled, the longest waiting time for confirm
  confirm_time_wait: 1m
  # Update countdown duration, update operation can still be cancelled in this window
  update_delay: 10s

  # If this is enabled and file is not found in upstream, original file will be deleted
  # It's suggested to enable this after upstreams are validated
  # Removing file is the intended operation while updating a not generated region
  remove_file_while_not_found: false

  # Prime Backup running config
  # RFUMulti matches PB log with these format here to determine if the file exists in PB databases
  # ONLY change this when PB change its log format of 'file not exist' scene

    - "File '{file_name}' in backup #{backup_id:d} does not exist"

# =========================================
# |          Paths Configuration          |
# =========================================
paths:
  # Prime Backup plugin package path
  # File name should be like 'PrimeBackup-v*.pyz' here
  # ONLY configure this item when PB is not installed in this MCDR instance
  # Requires PB version >= 1.7
  pb_plugin_package_path:

  # Destination world directory
  # Your current server world save location
  destination_world_directory: ./server/world

  # The current upstream
  # This can also be selected in game
  current_upstream: survival_pb

  # Upstream paths
  upstreams:
    # Usage:
    # <upstream_name>:
    #   type: 'prime_backup for' PB database path, 'world' for world save directory path
    #   path: path_to/prime_backup.db            | path_to/server_folder
    #   world_name: folder name of world save

    # Note that if world save folder is '../survival/server/world'
    # 'path' here should be its parent directory: '../survival/server', NOT its full path!!!
    # This tips only effective when 'type' is 'world'
    # For PB database, just fill it with path to prime_backup.db

    # Examples:
    survival_pb:
      type: prime_backup
      path: ../survival/pb_files/prime_backup.db
      world_name: world
    survival_qb:
      type: world
      path: ../survival/qb_multi/slot1
      world_name: world

  # To make this plugin compatible to different version of Minecraft
  # You can add file path format here
  # Custom dimension could also be added here to support them
  # Just use its namespace id like: my_datapack:my_custom_dims
